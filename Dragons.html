    <p id="description">
        Unlike the traditional Chinese and European dragons, which begin life as a smaller version of their serpeantine and quadripedal forms, 
        the Japanese dragon is unique in that it undergoes rather severe physical changes as it progresses through the beautiful stages of life.

    <h1> INFANCY </h1>

    <p>
        <br><br>The Japanese dragon begins life as a rambucious ball, akin to that pink slime they sell severely overpriced at carnivals and malls, that 
        you beg your parents to buy for you, except these have teeth. <br> As they lack arms, legs, necks, and torsos, they are pretty useless, so nature 
        has compensated by making them too cute to kill. <br> They can typically be found clinging to human children and consume nothing except protein and 
        "human friendship" and "heart of the cards" or whatever. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h1> ADOLESCENCE </h1>

    <p>
        <br><br>As the Japanese dragon ages, it go through the typical amphibian process of growing arms, legs, and a really stubby tail; except instead of growing
        large lungs, it gains the ability to breathe fireballs. This stage is also pretty useless, but at least it almost looks cool <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h1> ADULT </h1>

    <p>
        <br><br>Once the Japanese dragon has gained enough friendship points, it follows the natural evolutionary trail for reptiles and sprouts a full suit of medieval fantasy armor,
        complete with massively oversized talons and the ability to fly at hypersonic speeds. <br>Where does it come from? How does it fit? Can they take it off to use the bathroom? 
        The world may never know. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h1> FULL MATURITY </h1>
    <img src="images/dragon adult.jpg" alt="dragon mature" style="float: left; margin-right: 0px;"> 
    <p>
        <br><br>Following the train to its logical conclusion, the humble Japanese dragon will eventually blossom into the beautiful American-made AC130 Gunship, complete with 25mm, 40mm, and 
        even 105mm cannons mounted on either side, raining glorious freedom onto the heads, and schools, of anyone within half a hemester that doesn't have enough freedom in their hearts.
        <br> Truly, nature is a beautiful thing.
