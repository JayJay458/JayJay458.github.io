            <br><br>The Japanese dragon begins life as a rambucious ball, akin to that pink slime they sell severely overpriced at carnivals and malls, that 
            you beg your parents to buy for you, except these have teeth. <br> As they lack arms, legs, necks, and torsos, they are pretty useless, so nature 
            has compensated by making them too cute to kill. <br> They can typically be found clinging to human children and consume nothing except protein and 
            "human friendship" and "heart of the cards" or whatever.<br><br>
