    <p id="description">
        Unlike the traditional Chinese and European dragons, which begin life as a smaller version of their serpeantine and quadripedal forms, 
        the Japanese dragon is unique in that it undergoes rather severe physical changes as it progresses through the beautiful stages of life.
