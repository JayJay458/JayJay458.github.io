    <h1> GIRAFFES </h1>
    <h3> The true master of the skies <br> <br> </h3>

        <br><br>Long before the advent of those elitist fluffy menaces, the bird, there is another creature that held the title of King of the Wind: The Giraffe! <br>
        <br><br>

    <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 253, 253);"><br><br>It all began, as things usually do, with a disagreement. Girraffes, then adorable little munchkins, wanted to eat some short trees to stay alive. The trees 
        seemed to be oppossed to the suggestion and, like the average New Yorker trying to use the subway during our seasonal floods, hiked up their pants; growing out
        reach of those greedy giraffe mouths. (pictured to the right: the massive redwoods, one of natures desperate attempts to evade giraffe clutches.)<br><br><br><br><br>

    <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 253, 253);">
        <br><br>Of course, this didn't stop the mighty giraffe, who, adopting the old adage "anything you can do I can do better, " started elongating their necks to keep 
        munching on that sweet sweet tree juice. This was done partly out of survival and partly out of pure spite. (Pictured to the right: a -sadly incomplete- 
        chart of giraffevolution over time) Eventually, trees managed to grow so tall that giraffes couldn't continue elongating their necks without falling apart under 
        their own weight. Finally, the tree had gone where the giraffe could not follow<br> Or so they thought<br><br>
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 253, 253);">
        <br><br>Thankfully, giraffes do not like being told what they can, and cannot eat, and have decided as a collective: if we can't reach the trees on foot, we'll do it our own way"<br>
        Thus: the true majestic form of the giraffe revealed itself<br><br>

    <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 253, 253);"> <br><br> Nowadays, every giraffe on the planet sports a magnificent pair of giraffe-leather wings, and can be seen conquering the skies and, most impartantly, the trees. 
        The trees finally acknowledged their defeat, apologized for the inconvenience, and, in a show of surrender, agreed to lower themselves back to within easy-munching distance of giraffe mouths. This is why the trees in 
        the Sahara all look the way they do. <br><br>
